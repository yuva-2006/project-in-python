# project-in-python

This Python code utilizes the pyttsx3 library, which is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Here's a description for the code:

1.Library Import: The code begins by importing the pyttsx3 library.

2.Engine Initialization: The pyttsx3.init() function initializes the text-to-speech engine.

3.Voice Selection: The code retrieves the available voices using engine.getProperty("voices"). It then sets the voice using engine.setProperty("voice", voices[0].id). This selects the first available voice from the list of voices. Here we can get male voice while giving voices[0]. If we give voices[1] we can get female voice.

4.User Input: The code prompts the user to enter some text through the input() function. The entered text is stored in the text variable.

5.speak() Function Definition: A function named speak() is defined, which takes the text as input.

6.Text-to-Speech Conversion: Inside the speak() function, engine.say(text) is used to convert the input text to speech. Then, engine.runAndWait() is called to ensure that the speech is spoken synchronously.

7.Execution: Finally, the speak(text) function is called with the user-inputted text as its argument, causing the program to convert the text to speech using the selected voice.

This code essentially takes text input from the user and converts it into speech using the pyttsx3 library, allowing the computer to 'speak' the text provided by the user.
